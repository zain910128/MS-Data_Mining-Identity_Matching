### Problem statement:

The objective is to find the records / "enterprise id" which belong to the same person using only their demographic data

### Significance of the problem:

- With increase in adoption of EHR system and improvement in Health IT infrastructure across the system, there is a more than ever increasing need for integrating profiles and data across multiple systems
- It is critical to match profiles to create a comprehensive history of patientâ€™s health record and to improve interoperability in the system
- Health care providers must be able to share patient health information and accurately match a patient to his or her data from a different provider
- Matching mistakes can contribute toward adverse events, compromised safety and privacy, and increased health care costs due to repeat tests, and other factors
-The cost to manually correct mismatched patient records is estimated to be $60 per record not including the potential harm that could be caused due to a patient receiving the wrong treatment and potential legal fees
